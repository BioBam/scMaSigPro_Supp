            The count table, a numeric matrix of genes × cells, is the basic input data structure in the analysis of single-cell {RNA}-sequencing data. A common preprocessing step is to adjust the counts for variable sampling efficiency and to transform them so that the variance is similar across the dynamic range. These steps are intended to make subsequent application of generic statistical methods more palatable. Here, we describe four transformation approaches based on the delta method, model residuals, inferred latent expression state and factor analysis. We compare their strengths and weaknesses and find that the latter three have appealing theoretical properties; however, in benchmarks using simulated and real-world data, it turns out that a rather simple approach, namely, the logarithm with a pseudo-count followed by principal-component analysis, performs as well or better than the more sophisticated alternatives. This result highlights limitations of current theoretical analysis as assessed by bottom-line performance benchmarks.},

            Single cell genomics has become a popular approach to uncover the cellular heterogeneity of progenitor and terminally differentiated cell types with great precision. This approach can also delineate lineage hierarchies and identify molecular programmes of cell-fate acquisition and segregation. Nowadays, tens of thousands of cells are routinely sequenced in single cell-based methods and even more are expected to be analysed in the future. However, interpretation of the resulting data is challenging and requires computational models at multiple levels of abstraction. In contrast to other applications of single cell sequencing, where clustering approaches dominate, developmental systems are generally modelled using continuous structures, trajectories and trees. These trajectory models carry the promise of elucidating mechanisms of development, disease and stimulation response at very high molecular resolution. However, their reliable analysis and biological interpretation requires an understanding of their underlying assumptions and limitations. Here, we review the basic concepts of such computational approaches and discuss the characteristics of developmental processes that can be learnt from trajectory models.},

            Recently, lineage tracing technology using {CRISPR}/Cas9 genome editing has enabled simultaneous readouts of gene expressions and lineage barcodes, which allows for the reconstruction of the cell division tree and makes it possible to reconstruct ancestral cell types and trace the origin of each cell type. Meanwhile, trajectory inference methods are widely used to infer cell trajectories and pseudotime in a dynamic process using gene expression data of present-day cells. Here, we present {TedSim} (single-cell temporal dynamics simulator), which simulates the cell division events from the root cell to present-day cells, simultaneously generating two data modalities for each single cell: the lineage barcode and gene expression data. {TedSim} is a framework that connects the two problems: lineage tracing and trajectory inference. Using {TedSim}, we conducted analysis to show that (i) {TedSim} generates realistic gene expression and barcode data, as well as realistic relationships between these two data modalities; (ii) trajectory inference methods can recover the underlying cell state transition mechanism with balanced cell type compositions; and (iii) integrating gene expression and barcode data can provide more insights into the temporal dynamics in cell differentiation compared to using only one type of data, but better integration methods need to be developed.},

              Pseudotime analyses of single-cell {RNA}-seq data have become increasingly common. Typically, a latent trajectory corresponding to a biological process of interest—such as differentiation or cell cycle—is discovered. However, relatively little attention has been paid to modelling the differential expression of genes along such trajectories.
            
            
              Results
              We present switchde, a statistical framework and accompanying R package for identifying switch-like differential expression of genes along pseudotemporal trajectories. Our method includes fast model fitting that provides interpretable parameter estimates corresponding to how quickly a gene is up or down regulated as well as where in the trajectory such regulation occurs. It also reports a P-value in favour of rejecting a constant-expression model for switch-like differential expression and optionally models the zero-inflation prevalent in single-cell data.

              Motivation
              Computational models are needed to infer a representation of the cells, i.e. a trajectory, from single-cell {RNA}-sequencing data that model cell differentiation during a dynamic process. Although many trajectory inference methods exist, their performance varies greatly depending on the dataset and hence there is a need to establish more accurate, better generalizable methods.
            
            
              Results
              We introduce {scShaper}, a new trajectory inference method that enables accurate linear trajectory inference. The ensemble approach of {scShaper} generates a continuous smooth pseudotime based on a set of discrete pseudotimes. We demonstrate that {scShaper} is able to infer accurate trajectories for a variety of trigonometric trajectories, including many for which the commonly used principal curves method fails. A comprehensive benchmarking with state-of-the-art methods revealed that {scShaper} achieved superior accuracy of the cell ordering and, in particular, the differentially expressed genes. Moreover, {scShaper} is a fast method with few hyperparameters, making it a promising alternative to the principal curves method for linear pseudotemporal ordering.
            
            
              Availability and implementation
              {scShaper} is available as an R package at https://github.com/elolab/scshaper. The test data are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5734488.

	abstract = {Significance
            Seeing a snapshot of individuals at different stages of a dynamic process can reveal what the process would look like for a single individual over time. Biologists apply this principle to infer temporal sequences of gene expression states in cells from measurements made at a single moment in time. However, the sparsity and high dimensionality of single-cell data have made inference difficult using formal approaches. Here, we apply recent innovations in spectral graph theory to devise a simple and asymptotically exact algorithm for inferring the unique dynamic solution under defined approximations and apply it to data from bone marrow stem cells.
          , 
            Single-cell expression profiling reveals the molecular states of individual cells with unprecedented detail. Because these methods destroy cells in the process of analysis, they cannot measure how gene expression changes over time. However, some information on dynamics is present in the data: the continuum of molecular states in the population can reflect the trajectory of a typical cell. Many methods for extracting single-cell dynamics from population data have been proposed. However, all such attempts face a common limitation: for any measured distribution of cell states, there are multiple dynamics that could give rise to it, and by extension, multiple possibilities for underlying mechanisms of gene regulation. Here, we describe the aspects of gene expression dynamics that cannot be inferred from a static snapshot alone and identify assumptions necessary to constrain a unique solution for cell dynamics from static snapshots. We translate these constraints into a practical algorithmic approach, population balance analysis ({PBA}), which makes use of a method from spectral graph theory to solve a class of high-dimensional differential equations. We use simulations to show the strengths and limitations of {PBA}, and then apply it to single-cell profiles of hematopoietic progenitor cells ({HPCs}). Cell state predictions from this analysis agree with {HPC} fate assays reported in several papers over the past two decades. By highlighting the fundamental limits on dynamic inference faced by any method, our framework provides a rigorous basis for dynamic interpretation of a gene expression continuum and clarifies best experimental designs for trajectory reconstruction from static snapshot measurements.},

            Single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) is a powerful method for dissecting intercellular heterogeneity during development. Conventional trajectory analysis provides only a pseudotime of development, and often discards cell-cycle events as confounding factors. Here using matched cell population {RNA}-seq ({cpRNA}-seq) as a reference, we developed an “{iCpSc}” package for integrative analysis of {cpRNA}-seq and {scRNA}-seq data. By generating a computational model for reference “biological differentiation time” using cell population data and applying it to single-cell data, we unbiasedly associated cell-cycle checkpoints to the internal molecular timer of single cells. Through inferring a network flow from {cpRNA}-seq to {scRNA}-seq data, we predicted a role of M phase in controlling the speed of neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells, and validated it through gene knockout ({KO}) experiments. By linking temporally matched {cpRNA}-seq and {scRNA}-seq data, our approach provides an effective and unbiased approach for identifying developmental trajectory and timing-related regulatory events.},

            Despite recent advances in inferring cellular dynamics using single-cell {RNA}-seq data, existing trajectory inference ({TI}) methods face difficulty in accurately reconstructing the cell-state manifold and cell-fate plasticity for complex topologies. Here, we present {MARGARET} (https://github.com/Zafar-Lab/Margaret) for inferring single-cell trajectory and fate mapping for diverse dynamic cellular processes. {MARGARET} reconstructs complex trajectory topologies using a deep unsupervised metric learning and a graph-partitioning approach based on a novel connectivity measure, automatically detects terminal cell states, and generalizes the quantification of fate plasticity for complex topologies. On a diverse benchmark consisting of synthetic and real datasets, {MARGARET} outperformed state-of-the-art methods in recovering global topology and cell pseudotime ordering. For human hematopoiesis, {MARGARET} accurately identified all major lineages and associated gene expression trends and helped identify transitional progenitors associated with key branching events. For embryoid body differentiation, {MARGARET} identified novel transitional populations that were validated by bulk sequencing and functionally characterized different precursor populations in the mesoderm lineage. For colon differentiation, {MARGARET} characterized the lineage for {BEST}4/{OTOP}2 cells and the heterogeneity in goblet cell lineage in the colon under normal and inflamed ulcerative colitis conditions. Finally, we demonstrated that {MARGARET} can scale to large {scRNA}-seq datasets consisting of ∼ millions of cells.},

            Pseudotime algorithms can be employed to extract latent temporal information from cross-sectional data sets allowing dynamic biological processes to be studied in situations where the collection of time series data is challenging or prohibitive. Computational techniques have arisen from single-cell ‘omics and cancer modelling where pseudotime can be used to learn about cellular differentiation or tumour progression. However, methods to date typically implicitly assume homogeneous genetic, phenotypic or environmental backgrounds, which becomes limiting as data sets grow in size and complexity. We describe a novel statistical framework that learns how pseudotime trajectories can be modulated through covariates that encode such factors. We apply this model to both single-cell and bulk gene expression data sets and show that the approach can recover known and novel covariate-pseudotime interaction effects. This hybrid regression-latent variable model framework extends pseudotemporal modelling from its most prevalent area of single cell genomics to wider applications.},

              {INTRODUCTION}
              
                A reference atlas of human cell types is a major goal for the field. Here, we set out to generate single-cell atlases of both gene expression (this study) and chromatin accessibility (Domcke
                et al.
                , this issue) using diverse human tissues obtained during midgestation.
              
            
            
              {RATIONALE}
              
                Contemporary knowledge of the molecular basis of in vivo human development mostly derives from a combination of human genetics, in vivo investigations of model organisms, and in vitro studies of differentiating human cell lines, rather than through direct investigations of developing human tissues. Several challenges have historically limited the study of developing human tissues at the molecular level, including limited access, tissue degradation, and cell type heterogeneity. For this and the companion study (Domcke
                et al.
                , this issue), we were able to overcome these challenges.
              
            
            
              {RESULTS}
              We applied three-level single-cell combinatorial indexing for gene expression (sci-{RNA}-seq3) to 121 human fetal samples ranging from 72 to 129 days in estimated postconceptual age and representing 15 organs, altogether profiling 4 million single cells. We developed and applied a framework for quantifying cell type specificity, identifying 657 cell subtypes, which we preliminarily annotated based on cross-matching to mouse cell atlases. We identified and validated potentially circulating trophoblast-like and hepatoblast-like cells in unexpected tissues. Profiling gene expression in diverse tissues facilitated the cross-tissue analyses of broadly distributed cell types, including blood, endothelial, and epithelial cells. For blood cells, this yielded a multiorgan map of cell state trajectories from hematopoietic stem cells to all major sublineages. Multiple lines of evidence support the adrenal gland as a normal, albeit minor, site of erythropoiesis during fetal development. It was notably straightforward to integrate these human fetal data with a mouse embryonic cell atlas, despite differences in species and developmental stage. For some systems, this essentially permitted us to bridge gene expression dynamics from the embryonic to the fetal stages of mammalian development.
            
            
              {CONCLUSION}
              
                The single-cell data resource presented here is notable for its scale, its focus on human fetal development, the breadth of tissues analyzed, and the parallel generation of gene expression (this study) and chromatin accessibility data (Domcke
                et al.
                , this issue). We furthermore consolidate the technical framework for individual laboratories to generate and analyze gene expression and chromatin accessibility data from millions of single cells. Looking forward, we envision that the somewhat narrow window of midgestational human development studied here will be complemented by additional atlases of earlier and later time points, as well as similarly comprehensive profiling and integration of data from model organisms. The continued development and application of methods for ascertaining gene expression and chromatin accessibility—in concert with spatial, epigenetic, proteomic, lineage history, and other information—will be necessary to obtain a comprehensive view of the temporal unfolding of human cell type diversity that begins at the single-cell zygote. An interactive website facilitates the exploration of these freely available data by tissue, cell type, or gene (
                descartes.brotmanbaty.org
                ).
              
              
                
                  A human cell atlas of fetal gene expression enables the exploration of in vivo gene expression across diverse cell types.
                  We used a three-level combinatorial indexing assay (sci-{RNA}-seq3) to profile gene expression in {\textasciitilde}4,000,000 single cells from 15 fetal organs. This rich resource enables, for example, the identification and annotation of cell types, cross-tissue integration of broadly distributed cell types (e.g., blood, endothelial, and epithelial), and interspecies integration of mouse embryonic and human fetal cell atlases. {PCR}, polymerase chain reaction.
                
                
              
            
          , 
            The gene expression program underlying the specification of human cell types is of fundamental interest. We generated human cell atlases of gene expression and chromatin accessibility in fetal tissues. For gene expression, we applied three-level combinatorial indexing to {\textgreater}110 samples representing 15 organs, ultimately profiling {\textasciitilde}4 million single cells. We leveraged the literature and other atlases to identify and annotate hundreds of cell types and subtypes, both within and across tissues. Our analyses focused on organ-specific specializations of broadly distributed cell types (such as blood, endothelial, and epithelial), sites of fetal erythropoiesis (which notably included the adrenal gland), and integration with mouse developmental atlases (such as conserved specification of blood cells). These data represent a rich resource for the exploration of in vivo human gene expression in diverse tissues and cell types.},

To identify these dynamic effects in high resolution, we collected single-cell {RNA}-sequencing data over a differentiation time course from induced pluripotent stem cells to cardiomyocytes, sampled at 7 unique time points in 19 human cell lines. We employed a flexible approach to map dynamic {eQTLs} whose effects vary significantly over the course of bifurcating differentiation trajectories, including many whose effects are specific to one of these two lineages. Our study design allowed us to distinguish true dynamic {eQTLs} affecting a specific cell lineage from expression changes driven by potentially non-genetic differences between cell lines such as cell composition. Additionally, we used the cell type profiles learned from single-cell data to deconvolve and re-analyze data from matched bulk {RNA}-seq samples. Using this approach, we were able to identify a large number of novel dynamic {eQTLs} in single cell data while also attributing dynamic effects in bulk to a particular lineage. Overall, we found that using single cell data to uncover dynamic {eQTLs} can provide new insight into the gene regulatory changes that occur among heterogeneous cell types during cardiomyocyte differentiation.},

Recent scientific progress in experimental technologies have enabled the specific detection of epigenetic factors responsible for the maintenance and quiescence of the hematopoietic niche, which has improved our knowledge of regulatory mechanisms. The aberrant role of {RNA}-binding proteins and their impact on the disruption of stem cell biology have been reported by a number of recent studies. Despite recent modernization in hematopoietic microenvironment research avenues, our comprehension of the signaling mechanisms and interactive pathways responsible for integration of the hematopoietic niche is still limited. In the past few decades, zebrafish usage with regards to exploratory studies of the hematopoietic niche has expanded our knowledge for deeper understanding of novel cellular interactions. This review provides an update on the functional roles of different genetic and epigenetic factors and molecular signaling events at different sections of the hematopoietic microenvironment. The explorations of different molecular approaches and interventions of latest web-based tools being used are also outlined.

              To investigate molecular mechanisms underlying cell state changes, a crucial analysis is to identify differentially expressed ({DE}) genes along the pseudotime inferred from single-cell {RNA}-sequencing data. However, existing methods do not account for pseudotime inference uncertainty, and they have either ill-posed

            Trajectory inference has radically enhanced single-cell {RNA}-seq research by enabling the study of dynamic changes in gene expression. Downstream of trajectory inference, it is vital to discover genes that are (i) associated with the lineages in the trajectory, or (ii) differentially expressed between lineages, to illuminate the underlying biological processes. Current data analysis procedures, however, either fail to exploit the continuous resolution provided by trajectory inference, or fail to pinpoint the exact types of differential expression. We introduce {tradeSeq}, a powerful generalized additive model framework based on the negative binomial distribution that allows flexible inference of both within-lineage and between-lineage differential expression. By incorporating observation-level weights, the model additionally allows to account for zero inflation. We evaluate the method on simulated datasets and on real datasets from droplet-based and full-length protocols, and show that it yields biological insights through a clear interpretation of the data.},

            Motivation: Multi-series time-course microarray experiments are useful approaches for exploring biological processes. In this type of experiments, the researcher is frequently interested in studying gene expression changes along time and in evaluating trend differences between the various experimental groups. The large amount of data, multiplicity of experimental conditions and the dynamic nature of the experiments poses great challenges to data analysis.
            Results: In this work, we propose a statistical procedure to identify genes that show different gene expression profiles across analytical groups in time-course experiments. The method is a two-regression step approach where the experimental groups are identified by dummy variables. The procedure first adjusts a global regression model with all the defined variables to identify differentially expressed genes, and in second a variable selection strategy is applied to study differences between groups and to find statistically significant different profiles. The methodology is illustrated on both a real and a simulated microarray dataset.

            Differential expression analysis in single-cell transcriptomics enables the dissection of cell-type-specific responses to perturbations such as disease, trauma, or experimental manipulations. While many statistical methods are available to identify differentially expressed genes, the principles that distinguish these methods and their performance remain unclear. Here, we show that the relative performance of these methods is contingent on their ability to account for variation between biological replicates. Methods that ignore this inevitable variation are biased and prone to false discoveries. Indeed, the most widely used methods can discover hundreds of differentially expressed genes in the absence of biological differences. To exemplify these principles, we exposed true and false discoveries of differentially expressed genes in the injured mouse spinal cord.},

            Single-cell {RNA}-sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) enables researchers to quantify transcriptomes of thousands of cells simultaneously and study transcriptomic changes between cells. {scRNA}-seq datasets increasingly include multisubject, multicondition experiments to investigate cell-type-specific differential states ({DS}) between conditions. This can be performed by first identifying the cell types in all the subjects and then by performing a {DS} analysis between the conditions within each cell type. Naïve single-cell {DS} analysis methods that treat cells statistically independent are subject to false positives in the presence of variation between biological replicates, an issue known as the pseudoreplicate bias. While several methods have already been introduced to carry out the statistical testing in multisubject {scRNA}-seq analysis, comparisons that include all these methods are currently lacking. Here, we performed a comprehensive comparison of 18 methods for the identification of {DS} changes between conditions from multisubject {scRNA}-seq data. Our results suggest that the pseudobulk methods performed generally best. Both pseudobulks and mixed models that model the subjects as a random effect were superior compared with the naïve single-cell methods that do not model the subjects in any way. While the naïve models achieved higher sensitivity than the pseudobulk methods and the mixed models, they were subject to a high number of false positives. In addition, accounting for subjects through latent variable modeling did not improve the performance of the naïve methods.},

            Characterizing the transcriptome of individual cells is fundamental to understanding complex biological systems. We describe a droplet-based system that enables 3′ {mRNA} counting of tens of thousands of single cells per sample. Cell encapsulation, of up to 8 samples at a time, takes place in ∼6 min, with ∼50\% cell capture efficiency. To demonstrate the system’s technical performance, we collected transcriptome data from ∼250k single cells across 29 samples. We validated the sensitivity of the system and its ability to detect rare populations using cell lines and synthetic {RNAs}. We profiled 68k peripheral blood mononuclear cells to demonstrate the system’s ability to characterize large immune populations. Finally, we used sequence variation in the transcriptome data to determine host and donor chimerism at single-cell resolution from bone marrow mononuclear cells isolated from transplant patients.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Motivation: Single-cell technologies have recently gained popularity in cellular differentiation studies regarding their ability to resolve potential heterogeneities in cell populations. Analyzing such high-dimensional single-cell data has its own statistical and computational challenges. Popular multivariate approaches are based on data normalization, followed by dimension reduction and clustering to identify subgroups. However, in the case of cellular differentiation, we would not expect clear clusters to be present but instead expect the cells to follow continuous branching lineages.
            Results: Here, we propose the use of diffusion maps to deal with the problem of defining differentiation trajectories. We adapt this method to single-cell data by adequate choice of kernel width and inclusion of uncertainties or missing measurement values, which enables the establishment of a pseudotemporal ordering of single cells in a high-dimensional gene expression space. We expect this output to reflect cell differentiation trajectories, where the data originates from intrinsic diffusion-like dynamics. Starting from a pluripotent stage, cells move smoothly within the transcriptional landscape towards more differentiated states with some stochasticity along their path. We demonstrate the robustness of our method with respect to extrinsic noise (e.g. measurement noise) and sampling density heterogeneities on simulated toy data as well as two single-cell quantitative polymerase chain reaction datasets (i.e. mouse haematopoietic stem cells and mouse embryonic stem cells) and an {RNA}-Seq data of human pre-implantation embryos. We show that diffusion maps perform considerably better than Principal Component Analysis and are advantageous over other techniques for non-linear dimension reduction such as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding for preserving the global structures and pseudotemporal ordering of cells.

              Climate change is profoundly affecting nearly all aspects of life on earth, including human societies, economies, and health. Various human activities are responsible for significant greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions, including data centers and other sources of large‐scale computation. Although many important scientific milestones are achieved thanks to the development of high‐performance computing, the resultant environmental impact is underappreciated. In this work, a methodological framework to estimate the carbon footprint of any computational task in a standardized and reliable way is presented and metrics to contextualize {GHG} emissions are defined. A freely available online tool, Green Algorithms (
              www.green‐algorithms.org
              ) is developed, which enables a user to estimate and report the carbon footprint of their computation. The tool easily integrates with computational processes as it requires minimal information and does not interfere with existing code, while also accounting for a broad range of hardware configurations. Finally, the {GHG} emissions of algorithms used for particle physics simulations, weather forecasts, and natural language processing are quantified. Taken together, this study develops a simple generalizable framework and freely available tool to quantify the carbon footprint of nearly any computation. Combined with recommendations to minimize unnecessary {CO}
