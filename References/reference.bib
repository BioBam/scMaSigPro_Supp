              Motivation
              As sequencing technologies improve their capacity to detect distinct transcripts of the same gene and to address complex experimental designs such as longitudinal studies, there is a need to develop statistical methods for the analysis of isoform expression changes in time series data.
            
            
              Results
              Iso-{maSigPro} is a new functionality of the R package {maSigPro} for transcriptomics time series data analysis. Iso-{maSigPro} identifies genes with a differential isoform usage across time. The package also includes new clustering and visualization functions that allow grouping of genes with similar expression patterns at the isoform level, as well as those genes with a shift in major expressed isoform.

            Motivation: The widespread adoption of {RNA}-seq to quantitatively measure gene expression has increased the scope of sequencing experimental designs to include time-course experiments. {maSigPro} is an R package specifically suited for the analysis of time-course gene expression data, which was developed originally for microarrays and hence was limited in its application to count data.
            Results: We have updated {maSigPro} to support {RNA}-seq time series analysis by introducing generalized linear models in the algorithm to support the modeling of count data while maintaining the traditional functionalities of the package. We show a good performance of the {maSigPro}-{GLM} method in several simulated time-course scenarios and in a real experimental dataset.

            Motivation: Multi-series time-course microarray experiments are useful approaches for exploring biological processes. In this type of experiments, the researcher is frequently interested in studying gene expression changes along time and in evaluating trend differences between the various experimental groups. The large amount of data, multiplicity of experimental conditions and the dynamic nature of the experiments poses great challenges to data analysis.
            Results: In this work, we propose a statistical procedure to identify genes that show different gene expression profiles across analytical groups in time-course experiments. The method is a two-regression step approach where the experimental groups are identified by dummy variables. The procedure first adjusts a global regression model with all the defined variables to identify differentially expressed genes, and in second a variable selection strategy is applied to study differences between groups and to find statistically significant different profiles. The methodology is illustrated on both a real and a simulated microarray dataset.

            Trajectory inference has radically enhanced single-cell {RNA}-seq research by enabling the study of dynamic changes in gene expression. Downstream of trajectory inference, it is vital to discover genes that are (i) associated with the lineages in the trajectory, or (ii) differentially expressed between lineages, to illuminate the underlying biological processes. Current data analysis procedures, however, either fail to exploit the continuous resolution provided by trajectory inference, or fail to pinpoint the exact types of differential expression. We introduce {tradeSeq}, a powerful generalized additive model framework based on the negative binomial distribution that allows flexible inference of both within-lineage and between-lineage differential expression. By incorporating observation-level weights, the model additionally allows to account for zero inflation. We evaluate the method on simulated datasets and on real datasets from droplet-based and full-length protocols, and show that it yields biological insights through a clear interpretation of the data.},

              To investigate molecular mechanisms underlying cell state changes, a crucial analysis is to identify differentially expressed ({DE}) genes along the pseudotime inferred from single-cell {RNA}-sequencing data. However, existing methods do not account for pseudotime inference uncertainty, and they have either ill-posed
              p
              -values or restrictive models. Here we propose {PseudotimeDE}, a {DE} gene identification method that adapts to various pseudotime inference methods, accounts for pseudotime inference uncertainty, and outputs well-calibrated

Recent scientific progress in experimental technologies have enabled the specific detection of epigenetic factors responsible for the maintenance and quiescence of the hematopoietic niche, which has improved our knowledge of regulatory mechanisms. The aberrant role of {RNA}-binding proteins and their impact on the disruption of stem cell biology have been reported by a number of recent studies. Despite recent modernization in hematopoietic microenvironment research avenues, our comprehension of the signaling mechanisms and interactive pathways responsible for integration of the hematopoietic niche is still limited. In the past few decades, zebrafish usage with regards to exploratory studies of the hematopoietic niche has expanded our knowledge for deeper understanding of novel cellular interactions. This review provides an update on the functional roles of different genetic and epigenetic factors and molecular signaling events at different sections of the hematopoietic microenvironment. The explorations of different molecular approaches and interventions of latest web-based tools being used are also outlined.

To identify these dynamic effects in high resolution, we collected single-cell {RNA}-sequencing data over a differentiation time course from induced pluripotent stem cells to cardiomyocytes, sampled at 7 unique time points in 19 human cell lines. We employed a flexible approach to map dynamic {eQTLs} whose effects vary significantly over the course of bifurcating differentiation trajectories, including many whose effects are specific to one of these two lineages. Our study design allowed us to distinguish true dynamic {eQTLs} affecting a specific cell lineage from expression changes driven by potentially non-genetic differences between cell lines such as cell composition. Additionally, we used the cell type profiles learned from single-cell data to deconvolve and re-analyze data from matched bulk {RNA}-seq samples. Using this approach, we were able to identify a large number of novel dynamic {eQTLs} in single cell data while also attributing dynamic effects in bulk to a particular lineage. Overall, we found that using single cell data to uncover dynamic {eQTLs} can provide new insight into the gene regulatory changes that occur among heterogeneous cell types during cardiomyocyte differentiation.},

              {INTRODUCTION}
              
                A reference atlas of human cell types is a major goal for the field. Here, we set out to generate single-cell atlases of both gene expression (this study) and chromatin accessibility (Domcke
                et al.
                , this issue) using diverse human tissues obtained during midgestation.
              
            
            
              {RATIONALE}
              
                Contemporary knowledge of the molecular basis of in vivo human development mostly derives from a combination of human genetics, in vivo investigations of model organisms, and in vitro studies of differentiating human cell lines, rather than through direct investigations of developing human tissues. Several challenges have historically limited the study of developing human tissues at the molecular level, including limited access, tissue degradation, and cell type heterogeneity. For this and the companion study (Domcke
                et al.
                , this issue), we were able to overcome these challenges.
              
            
            
              {RESULTS}
              We applied three-level single-cell combinatorial indexing for gene expression (sci-{RNA}-seq3) to 121 human fetal samples ranging from 72 to 129 days in estimated postconceptual age and representing 15 organs, altogether profiling 4 million single cells. We developed and applied a framework for quantifying cell type specificity, identifying 657 cell subtypes, which we preliminarily annotated based on cross-matching to mouse cell atlases. We identified and validated potentially circulating trophoblast-like and hepatoblast-like cells in unexpected tissues. Profiling gene expression in diverse tissues facilitated the cross-tissue analyses of broadly distributed cell types, including blood, endothelial, and epithelial cells. For blood cells, this yielded a multiorgan map of cell state trajectories from hematopoietic stem cells to all major sublineages. Multiple lines of evidence support the adrenal gland as a normal, albeit minor, site of erythropoiesis during fetal development. It was notably straightforward to integrate these human fetal data with a mouse embryonic cell atlas, despite differences in species and developmental stage. For some systems, this essentially permitted us to bridge gene expression dynamics from the embryonic to the fetal stages of mammalian development.
            
            
              {CONCLUSION}
              
                The single-cell data resource presented here is notable for its scale, its focus on human fetal development, the breadth of tissues analyzed, and the parallel generation of gene expression (this study) and chromatin accessibility data (Domcke
                et al.
                , this issue). We furthermore consolidate the technical framework for individual laboratories to generate and analyze gene expression and chromatin accessibility data from millions of single cells. Looking forward, we envision that the somewhat narrow window of midgestational human development studied here will be complemented by additional atlases of earlier and later time points, as well as similarly comprehensive profiling and integration of data from model organisms. The continued development and application of methods for ascertaining gene expression and chromatin accessibility—in concert with spatial, epigenetic, proteomic, lineage history, and other information—will be necessary to obtain a comprehensive view of the temporal unfolding of human cell type diversity that begins at the single-cell zygote. An interactive website facilitates the exploration of these freely available data by tissue, cell type, or gene (
                descartes.brotmanbaty.org
                ).
              
              
                
                  A human cell atlas of fetal gene expression enables the exploration of in vivo gene expression across diverse cell types.
                  We used a three-level combinatorial indexing assay (sci-{RNA}-seq3) to profile gene expression in {\textasciitilde}4,000,000 single cells from 15 fetal organs. This rich resource enables, for example, the identification and annotation of cell types, cross-tissue integration of broadly distributed cell types (e.g., blood, endothelial, and epithelial), and interspecies integration of mouse embryonic and human fetal cell atlases. {PCR}, polymerase chain reaction.
                
                
              
            
          , 
            The gene expression program underlying the specification of human cell types is of fundamental interest. We generated human cell atlases of gene expression and chromatin accessibility in fetal tissues. For gene expression, we applied three-level combinatorial indexing to {\textgreater}110 samples representing 15 organs, ultimately profiling {\textasciitilde}4 million single cells. We leveraged the literature and other atlases to identify and annotate hundreds of cell types and subtypes, both within and across tissues. Our analyses focused on organ-specific specializations of broadly distributed cell types (such as blood, endothelial, and epithelial), sites of fetal erythropoiesis (which notably included the adrenal gland), and integration with mouse developmental atlases (such as conserved specification of blood cells). These data represent a rich resource for the exploration of in vivo human gene expression in diverse tissues and cell types.},

            Single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) is a powerful method for dissecting intercellular heterogeneity during development. Conventional trajectory analysis provides only a pseudotime of development, and often discards cell-cycle events as confounding factors. Here using matched cell population {RNA}-seq ({cpRNA}-seq) as a reference, we developed an “{iCpSc}” package for integrative analysis of {cpRNA}-seq and {scRNA}-seq data. By generating a computational model for reference “biological differentiation time” using cell population data and applying it to single-cell data, we unbiasedly associated cell-cycle checkpoints to the internal molecular timer of single cells. Through inferring a network flow from {cpRNA}-seq to {scRNA}-seq data, we predicted a role of M phase in controlling the speed of neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells, and validated it through gene knockout ({KO}) experiments. By linking temporally matched {cpRNA}-seq and {scRNA}-seq data, our approach provides an effective and unbiased approach for identifying developmental trajectory and timing-related regulatory events.},

            Pseudotime algorithms can be employed to extract latent temporal information from cross-sectional data sets allowing dynamic biological processes to be studied in situations where the collection of time series data is challenging or prohibitive. Computational techniques have arisen from single-cell ‘omics and cancer modelling where pseudotime can be used to learn about cellular differentiation or tumour progression. However, methods to date typically implicitly assume homogeneous genetic, phenotypic or environmental backgrounds, which becomes limiting as data sets grow in size and complexity. We describe a novel statistical framework that learns how pseudotime trajectories can be modulated through covariates that encode such factors. We apply this model to both single-cell and bulk gene expression data sets and show that the approach can recover known and novel covariate-pseudotime interaction effects. This hybrid regression-latent variable model framework extends pseudotemporal modelling from its most prevalent area of single cell genomics to wider applications.},

            Despite recent advances in inferring cellular dynamics using single-cell {RNA}-seq data, existing trajectory inference ({TI}) methods face difficulty in accurately reconstructing the cell-state manifold and cell-fate plasticity for complex topologies. Here, we present {MARGARET} (https://github.com/Zafar-Lab/Margaret) for inferring single-cell trajectory and fate mapping for diverse dynamic cellular processes. {MARGARET} reconstructs complex trajectory topologies using a deep unsupervised metric learning and a graph-partitioning approach based on a novel connectivity measure, automatically detects terminal cell states, and generalizes the quantification of fate plasticity for complex topologies. On a diverse benchmark consisting of synthetic and real datasets, {MARGARET} outperformed state-of-the-art methods in recovering global topology and cell pseudotime ordering. For human hematopoiesis, {MARGARET} accurately identified all major lineages and associated gene expression trends and helped identify transitional progenitors associated with key branching events. For embryoid body differentiation, {MARGARET} identified novel transitional populations that were validated by bulk sequencing and functionally characterized different precursor populations in the mesoderm lineage. For colon differentiation, {MARGARET} characterized the lineage for {BEST}4/{OTOP}2 cells and the heterogeneity in goblet cell lineage in the colon under normal and inflamed ulcerative colitis conditions. Finally, we demonstrated that {MARGARET} can scale to large {scRNA}-seq datasets consisting of ∼ millions of cells.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Seeing a snapshot of individuals at different stages of a dynamic process can reveal what the process would look like for a single individual over time. Biologists apply this principle to infer temporal sequences of gene expression states in cells from measurements made at a single moment in time. However, the sparsity and high dimensionality of single-cell data have made inference difficult using formal approaches. Here, we apply recent innovations in spectral graph theory to devise a simple and asymptotically exact algorithm for inferring the unique dynamic solution under defined approximations and apply it to data from bone marrow stem cells.
          , 
            Single-cell expression profiling reveals the molecular states of individual cells with unprecedented detail. Because these methods destroy cells in the process of analysis, they cannot measure how gene expression changes over time. However, some information on dynamics is present in the data: the continuum of molecular states in the population can reflect the trajectory of a typical cell. Many methods for extracting single-cell dynamics from population data have been proposed. However, all such attempts face a common limitation: for any measured distribution of cell states, there are multiple dynamics that could give rise to it, and by extension, multiple possibilities for underlying mechanisms of gene regulation. Here, we describe the aspects of gene expression dynamics that cannot be inferred from a static snapshot alone and identify assumptions necessary to constrain a unique solution for cell dynamics from static snapshots. We translate these constraints into a practical algorithmic approach, population balance analysis ({PBA}), which makes use of a method from spectral graph theory to solve a class of high-dimensional differential equations. We use simulations to show the strengths and limitations of {PBA}, and then apply it to single-cell profiles of hematopoietic progenitor cells ({HPCs}). Cell state predictions from this analysis agree with {HPC} fate assays reported in several papers over the past two decades. By highlighting the fundamental limits on dynamic inference faced by any method, our framework provides a rigorous basis for dynamic interpretation of a gene expression continuum and clarifies best experimental designs for trajectory reconstruction from static snapshot measurements.},

              Motivation
              Computational models are needed to infer a representation of the cells, i.e. a trajectory, from single-cell {RNA}-sequencing data that model cell differentiation during a dynamic process. Although many trajectory inference methods exist, their performance varies greatly depending on the dataset and hence there is a need to establish more accurate, better generalizable methods.
            
            
              Results
              We introduce {scShaper}, a new trajectory inference method that enables accurate linear trajectory inference. The ensemble approach of {scShaper} generates a continuous smooth pseudotime based on a set of discrete pseudotimes. We demonstrate that {scShaper} is able to infer accurate trajectories for a variety of trigonometric trajectories, including many for which the commonly used principal curves method fails. A comprehensive benchmarking with state-of-the-art methods revealed that {scShaper} achieved superior accuracy of the cell ordering and, in particular, the differentially expressed genes. Moreover, {scShaper} is a fast method with few hyperparameters, making it a promising alternative to the principal curves method for linear pseudotemporal ordering.

              Motivation
              Pseudotime analyses of single-cell {RNA}-seq data have become increasingly common. Typically, a latent trajectory corresponding to a biological process of interest—such as differentiation or cell cycle—is discovered. However, relatively little attention has been paid to modelling the differential expression of genes along such trajectories.
            
            
              Results
              We present switchde, a statistical framework and accompanying R package for identifying switch-like differential expression of genes along pseudotemporal trajectories. Our method includes fast model fitting that provides interpretable parameter estimates corresponding to how quickly a gene is up or down regulated as well as where in the trajectory such regulation occurs. It also reports a P-value in favour of rejecting a constant-expression model for switch-like differential expression and optionally models the zero-inflation prevalent in single-cell data.

            Recently, lineage tracing technology using {CRISPR}/Cas9 genome editing has enabled simultaneous readouts of gene expressions and lineage barcodes, which allows for the reconstruction of the cell division tree and makes it possible to reconstruct ancestral cell types and trace the origin of each cell type. Meanwhile, trajectory inference methods are widely used to infer cell trajectories and pseudotime in a dynamic process using gene expression data of present-day cells. Here, we present {TedSim} (single-cell temporal dynamics simulator), which simulates the cell division events from the root cell to present-day cells, simultaneously generating two data modalities for each single cell: the lineage barcode and gene expression data. {TedSim} is a framework that connects the two problems: lineage tracing and trajectory inference. Using {TedSim}, we conducted analysis to show that (i) {TedSim} generates realistic gene expression and barcode data, as well as realistic relationships between these two data modalities; (ii) trajectory inference methods can recover the underlying cell state transition mechanism with balanced cell type compositions; and (iii) integrating gene expression and barcode data can provide more insights into the temporal dynamics in cell differentiation compared to using only one type of data, but better integration methods need to be developed.},

Differential expression analysis is the primary downstream analysis of such data to identify gene markers for cell type detection and also provide inputs to other secondary analyses. Many statistical approaches for differential expression analysis have been reported in the literature. Therefore, we critically discuss the underlying statistical principles of the approaches and distinctly divide them into six major classes, i.e., generalized linear, generalized additive, Hurdle, mixture models, two-class parametric, and non-parametric approaches.

A number of challenges are identified in this study that must be addressed to develop the next class of innovative approaches.

Such background noise is attributed to spillage from cell-free ambient {RNA} or barcode swapping events.
            
            
              Results
              Here, we characterize this background noise exemplified by three {scRNA}-seq and two {snRNA}-seq replicates of mouse kidneys. For each experiment, cells from two mouse subspecies are pooled, allowing to identify cross-genotype contaminating molecules and thus profile background noise. Background noise is highly variable across replicates and cells, making up on average 3–35\% of the total counts ({UMIs}) per cell and we find that noise levels are directly proportional to the specificity and detectability of marker genes. In search of the source of background noise, we find multiple lines of evidence that the majority of background molecules originates from ambient {RNA}. Finally, we use our genotype-based estimates to evaluate the performance of three methods ({CellBender}, {DecontX}, {SoupX}) that are designed to quantify and remove background noise. We find that {CellBender} provides the most precise estimates of background noise levels and also yields the highest improvement for marker gene detection. By contrast, clustering and classification of cells are fairly robust towards background noise and only small improvements can be achieved by background removal that may come at the cost of distortions in fine structure.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our findings help to better understand the extent, sources and impact of background noise in single-cell experiments and provide guidance on how to deal with it.},

            {RNA}-sequencing has become one of the most used high-throughput approaches to gain knowledge about the expression of all different {RNA} subpopulations. However, technical artifacts, either introduced during library preparation and/or data analysis, can influence the detected {RNA} expression levels. A critical step, especially in large and low input datasets or studies, is data normalization, which aims at eliminating the variability in data that is not related to biology. Many normalization methods have been developed, each of them relying on different assumptions, making the selection of the appropriate normalization strategy key to preserve biological information. To address this, we developed {NormSeq}, a free web-server tool to systematically assess the performance of normalization methods in a given dataset. A key feature of {NormSeq} is the implementation of information gain to guide the selection of the best normalization method, which is crucial to eliminate or at least reduce non-biological variability. Altogether, {NormSeq} provides an easy-to-use platform to explore different aspects of gene expression data with a special focus on data normalization to help researchers, even without bioinformatics expertise, to obtain reliable biological inference from their data. {NormSeq} is freely available at: https://arn.ugr.es/{normSeq}.},

              Motivation
              Single-cell sequencing ({SCS}) enables exploring the pathways and processes of cells, and cell populations. However, there is a paucity of pathway enrichment methods designed to tolerate the high noise and low gene coverage of this technology. When gene expression data are noisy and signals are sparse, testing pathway enrichment based on the genes expression may not yield statistically significant results which is particularly problematic when detecting the pathways enriched in less abundant cells that are vulnerable to disturbances.
            
            
              Results
              In this project, we developed a Weighted Concept Signature Enrichment Analysis ({WCSEA}) specialized for pathway enrichment analysis from single cell transcriptomics ({scRNA}-seq). {WCSEA} took a broader approach for assessing the functional relations of pathway gene sets to differentially expressed genes, and leverage the cumulative signature of molecular concepts characteristic of the highly differentially expressed genes, which we termed as the universal concept signature, to tolerate the high noise and low coverage of this technology. We then incorporated {WCSEA} into an R package called “{IndepthPathway}” for biologists to broadly leverage this method for pathway analysis based on bulk and single cell sequencing data. Through simulating technical variability and dropouts in gene expression characteristic of {scRNA}-seq as well as benchmarking on a real dataset of matched single cell and bulk {RNAseq} data, we demonstrate that {IndepthPathway} presents outstanding stability and depth in pathway enrichment results under stochasticity of the data, thus will substantially improve the scientific rigor of the pathway analysis for single cell sequencing data.

              Clonal evolution in myelodysplastic syndrome ({MDS}) can result in clinical progression and secondary acute myeloid leukemia ({sAML}). To dissect changes in clonal architecture associated with this progression, we performed single-cell genotyping of paired {MDS} and {sAML} samples from 18 patients. Analysis of single-cell genotypes revealed patient-specific clonal evolution and enabled the assessment of single-cell mutational cooccurrence. We discovered that changes in clonal architecture proceed via distinct patterns, classified as static or dynamic, with dynamic clonal architectures having a more proliferative phenotype by blast count fold change. Proteogenomic analysis of a subset of patients confirmed that pathogenic mutations were primarily confined to primitive and mature myeloid cells, though we also identify rare but present mutations in lymphocyte subsets. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of paired sample sets further identified gene sets and signaling pathways involved in two cases of progression. Together, these data define serial changes in the {MDS} clonal landscape with clinical and therapeutic implications.
            
            
              Significance:
              Precise clonal trajectories in {MDS} progression are made possible by single-cell genomic sequencing. Here we use this technology to uncover the patterns of clonal architecture and clonal evolution that drive the transformation to secondary {AML}. We further define the phenotypic and transcriptional changes of disease progression at the single-cell level.

              Background
              A key task in single-cell {RNA}-seq ({scRNA}-seq) data analysis is to accurately detect the number of cell types in the sample, which can be critical for downstream analyses such as cell type identification. Various {scRNA}-seq data clustering algorithms have been specifically designed to automatically estimate the number of cell types through optimising the number of clusters in a dataset. The lack of benchmark studies, however, complicates the choice of the methods.
            
            
              Results
              We systematically benchmark a range of popular clustering algorithms on estimating the number of cell types in a variety of settings by sampling from the Tabula Muris data to create {scRNA}-seq datasets with a varying number of cell types, varying number of cells in each cell type, and different cell type proportions. The large number of datasets enables us to assess the performance of the algorithms, covering four broad categories of approaches, from various aspects using a panel of criteria. We further cross-compared the performance on datasets with high cell numbers using Tabula Muris and Tabula Sapiens data.
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                We identify the strengths and weaknesses of each method on multiple criteria including the deviation of estimation from the true number of cell types, variability of estimation, clustering concordance of cells to their predefined cell types, and running time and peak memory usage. We then summarise these results into a multi-aspect recommendation to the users.

We applied {TraSig} to several {scRNA}-Seq datasets and obtained unique predictions that improve upon those identified by prior methods. Functional experiments validate the ability of {TraSig} to identify novel signaling interactions that impact vascular development in liver organoids.

            Trajectory inference has radically enhanced single-cell {RNA}-seq research by enabling the study of dynamic changes in gene expression. Downstream of trajectory inference, it is vital to discover genes that are (i) associated with the lineages in the trajectory, or (ii) differentially expressed between lineages, to illuminate the underlying biological processes. Current data analysis procedures, however, either fail to exploit the continuous resolution provided by trajectory inference, or fail to pinpoint the exact types of differential expression. We introduce {tradeSeq}, a powerful generalized additive model framework based on the negative binomial distribution that allows flexible inference of both within-lineage and between-lineage differential expression. By incorporating observation-level weights, the model additionally allows to account for zero inflation. We evaluate the method on simulated datasets and on real datasets from droplet-based and full-length protocols, and show that it yields biological insights through a clear interpretation of the data.},

            Motivation: Multi-series time-course microarray experiments are useful approaches for exploring biological processes. In this type of experiments, the researcher is frequently interested in studying gene expression changes along time and in evaluating trend differences between the various experimental groups. The large amount of data, multiplicity of experimental conditions and the dynamic nature of the experiments poses great challenges to data analysis.
            Results: In this work, we propose a statistical procedure to identify genes that show different gene expression profiles across analytical groups in time-course experiments. The method is a two-regression step approach where the experimental groups are identified by dummy variables. The procedure first adjusts a global regression model with all the defined variables to identify differentially expressed genes, and in second a variable selection strategy is applied to study differences between groups and to find statistically significant different profiles. The methodology is illustrated on both a real and a simulated microarray dataset.

Traditionally, cells have been classified by their morphology or by expression of certain proteins in functionally distinct settings. The advent of next generation sequencing ({NGS}) technologies paved the way for the detection and quantitative analysis of cellular content. In this context, transcriptome quantification techniques made their advent, starting from the bulk {RNA} sequencing, unable to dissect the heterogeneity of a sample, and moving to the first single cell techniques capable of analyzing a small number of cells (1–100), arriving at the current single cell techniques able to generate hundreds of thousands of cells. As experimental protocols have improved rapidly, computational workflows for processing the data have also been refined, opening up to novel methods capable of scaling computational times more favorably with the dataset size and making {scRNA}-seq much better suited for biomedical research. In this perspective, we will highlight the key technological and computational developments which have enabled the analysis of this growing data, making the {scRNA}-seq a handy tool in clinical applications.},

            Single cell genomics has become a popular approach to uncover the cellular heterogeneity of progenitor and terminally differentiated cell types with great precision. This approach can also delineate lineage hierarchies and identify molecular programmes of cell-fate acquisition and segregation. Nowadays, tens of thousands of cells are routinely sequenced in single cell-based methods and even more are expected to be analysed in the future. However, interpretation of the resulting data is challenging and requires computational models at multiple levels of abstraction. In contrast to other applications of single cell sequencing, where clustering approaches dominate, developmental systems are generally modelled using continuous structures, trajectories and trees. These trajectory models carry the promise of elucidating mechanisms of development, disease and stimulation response at very high molecular resolution. However, their reliable analysis and biological interpretation requires an understanding of their underlying assumptions and limitations. Here, we review the basic concepts of such computational approaches and discuss the characteristics of developmental processes that can be learnt from trajectory models.},

              Cancer-associated fibroblasts ({CAFs}) are the predominant components of the tumor microenvironment ({TME}) and influence cancer hallmarks, but without systematic investigation on their ubiquitous characteristics across different cancer types. Here, we perform pan-cancer analysis on 226 samples across 10 solid cancer types to profile the {TME} at single-cell resolution, illustrating the commonalities/plasticity of heterogenous {CAFs}. Activation trajectory of the major {CAF} types is divided into three states, exhibiting distinct interactions with other cell components, and relating to prognosis of immunotherapy. Moreover, minor {CAF} components represent the alternative origin from other {TME} components (e.g., endothelia and macrophages). Particularly, the ubiquitous presentation of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition {CAF}, which may interact with proximal {SPP}

However, paradoxically, although {HSCs} can be defined by function and even purified to near-homogeneity, the intricate molecular machinery and the signaling mechanisms regulating fate events, such as self-renewal and differentiation, have remained elusive. Recently, several developmentally conserved signaling pathways have emerged as important control devices of {HSC} fate, including Notch, Wingless-type (Wnt), Sonic hedgehog (Shh), and Smad pathways. {HSCs} reside in a complex environment in the bone marrow, providing a niche that optimally balances signals that control self-renewal and differentiation. These signaling circuits provide a valuable structure for our understanding of how {HSC} regulation occurs, concomitantly with providing information of how the bone marrow microenvironment couples and integrates extrinsic with intrinsic {HSC} fate determinants. It is the focus of this review to highlight some of the most recent developments concerning signaling pathways governing {HSC} fate.},

            Single-cell genomics technology has transformed our understanding of complex cellular systems. However, excessive cost and a lack of strategies for the purification of newly identified cell types impede their functional characterization and large-scale profiling. Here, we have generated high-content single-cell proteo-genomic reference maps of human blood and bone marrow that quantitatively link the expression of up to 197 surface markers to cellular identities and biological processes across all main hematopoietic cell types in healthy aging and leukemia. These reference maps enable the automatic design of cost-effective high-throughput cytometry schemes that outperform state-of-the-art approaches, accurately reflect complex topologies of cellular systems and permit the purification of precisely defined cell states. The systematic integration of cytometry and proteo-genomic data enables the functional capacities of precisely mapped cell states to be measured at the single-cell level. Our study serves as an accessible resource and paves the way for a data-driven era in cytometry.},

            The count table, a numeric matrix of genes × cells, is the basic input data structure in the analysis of single-cell {RNA}-sequencing data. A common preprocessing step is to adjust the counts for variable sampling efficiency and to transform them so that the variance is similar across the dynamic range. These steps are intended to make subsequent application of generic statistical methods more palatable. Here, we describe four transformation approaches based on the delta method, model residuals, inferred latent expression state and factor analysis. We compare their strengths and weaknesses and find that the latter three have appealing theoretical properties; however, in benchmarks using simulated and real-world data, it turns out that a rather simple approach, namely, the logarithm with a pseudo-count followed by principal-component analysis, performs as well or better than the more sophisticated alternatives. This result highlights limitations of current theoretical analysis as assessed by bottom-line performance benchmarks.},

	abstract = {Single-cell {RNA}-seq ({scRNA}-seq) technologies are broadly applied to dissect the cellular heterogeneity and expression dynamics, providing unprecedented insights into single-cell biology. Most of the {scRNA}-seq studies mainly focused on the dissection of cell types/states, developmental trajectory, gene regulatory network, and alternative splicing. However, besides these routine analyses, many other valuable {scRNA}-seq investigations can be conducted. Here, we first review cell-to-cell communication exploration, {RNA} velocity inference, identification of large-scale copy number variations and single nucleotide changes, and chromatin accessibility prediction based on single-cell transcriptomics data. Next, we discuss the identification of novel genes/transcripts through transcriptome reconstruction approaches, as well as the profiling of long non-coding {RNAs} and circular {RNAs}. Additionally, we survey the integration of single-cell and bulk {RNA}-seq datasets for deconvoluting the cell composition of large-scale bulk samples and linking single-cell signatures to patient outcomes. These additional analyses could largely facilitate corresponding basic science and clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Vitiligo is a chronic asymptomatic disorder affecting melanocytes from the basal layer of the epidermis which leads to a patchy loss of skin color. Even though it is one of the neglected disease conditions, people suffering from vitiligo are more prone to psychological disorders. As of now, various studies have been done in order to project auto-immune implications as the root cause. To understand the complexity of vitiligo, we propose the Vitiligo Information Resource ({VIRdb}) that integrates both the drug-target and systems approach to produce a comprehensive repository entirely devoted to vitiligo, along with curated information at both protein level and gene level along with potential therapeutics leads. These 25,041 natural compounds are curated from Natural Product Activity and Species Source Database. {VIRdb} is an attempt to accelerate the drug discovery process and laboratory trials for vitiligo through the computationally derived potential drugs. It is an exhaustive resource consisting of 129 differentially expressed genes, which are validated through gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis. We also report 22 genes through enrichment analysis which are involved in the regulation of epithelial cell differentiation. At the protein level, 40 curated protein target molecules along with their natural hits that are derived through virtual screening. We also demonstrate the utility of the {VIRdb} by exploring the Protein–Protein Interaction Network and Gene–Gene Interaction Network of the target proteins and differentially expressed genes. For maintaining the quality and standard of the data in the {VIRdb}, the gold standard in bioinformatics toolkits like Cytoscape, Schrödinger’s {GLIDE}, along with the server installation of {MATLAB}, are used for generating results. {VIRdb} can be accessed through “

In the present work, we discuss the comprehensive set of differentially co-expressed genes involved in the crosstalk events between Vitiligo and associated autoimmune disorders (Psoriasis, Multiple Sclerosis and Rheumatoid Arthritis). We progress our previous tool, Vitiligo Information Resource ({VIRdb}), and incorporate into it a compendium of Vitiligo-related multi-omics datasets and present it as {VIRdb} 2.0. It is available as a web-resource consisting of statistically sound and manually curated information. {VIRdb} 2.0 is an integrative database as its datasets are connected to {KEGG}, {STRING}, {GeneCards}, {SwissProt}, {NPASS}. Through the present study, we communicate the major updates and expansions in the {VIRdb} and deliver the new version as {VIRdb} 2.0. {VIRdb} 2.0 offers the maximum user interactivity along with ease of navigation. We envision that {VIRdb} 2.0 will be pertinent for the researchers and clinicians engaged in drug development for vitiligo.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Cytosolic functions of Long non-coding {RNAs} including {mRNA} translation masking and sponging are major regulators of biological pathways. Formation of T cell-bounded hypoxic granuloma is a host immune defence for containing infected Mtb-macrophages. Our study exploits the mechanistic pathway of Mtb-induced {HIF}1A silencing by the antisense {lncRNA}-{HIF}1A-{AS}2 in T cells. Computational analysis of in-vitro T-cell stimulation assays in progressors (n=119) versus non-progressor (n=221) tuberculosis patients revealed the role of {lncRNA} mediated disruption of hypoxia adaptation pathways in progressors. We found 291 upregulated and 227 downregulated {DE} {lncRNAs} that were correlated at {mRNA} level with {HIF}1A and {HILPDA} which are major players in hypoxia response. We also report novel {lncRNA}-{AC}010655 ({AC}010655.4 and {AC}010655.2) in cis with {HILPDA}, both of which contain binding sites for the {BARX}2 transcription factor, thus indicating a mechanistic role. Detailed comparison of infection with antigenic stimulation showed a non-random enrichment of {lncRNAs} in the cytoplasmic fraction of the cell in {TB} progressors. The lack of this pattern in non-progressors replicates indicates the hijacking of the {lncRNA} dynamics by Mtb. The in-vitro manifestation of this response in the absence of granuloma indicates pre-programmed host-pathogen interaction between T-cells and Mtb regulated through {lncRNAs}, thus tipping this balance towards progression or containment of Mtb. Finally, we trained multiple machine learning classifiers for reliable prediction of latent to the active progression of patients, yielding a model to guide aggressive treatment.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The growing availability of single-cell data, especially transcriptomics, has sparked an increased interest in the inference of cell-cell communication. Many computational tools were developed for this purpose. Each of them consists of a resource of intercellular interactions prior knowledge and a method to predict potential cell-cell communication events. Yet the impact of the choice of resource and method on the resulting predictions is largely unknown. To shed light on this, we systematically compare 16 cell-cell communication inference resources and 7 methods, plus the consensus between the methods’ predictions. Among the resources, we find few unique interactions, a varying degree of overlap, and an uneven coverage of specific pathways and tissue-enriched proteins. We then examine all possible combinations of methods and resources and show that both strongly influence the predicted intercellular interactions. Finally, we assess the agreement of cell-cell communication methods with spatial colocalisation, cytokine activities, and receptor protein abundance and find that predictions are generally coherent with those data modalities. To facilitate the use of the methods and resources described in this work, we provide {LIANA}, a {LIgand}-receptor {ANalysis} {frAmework} as an open-source interface to all the resources and methods.},
